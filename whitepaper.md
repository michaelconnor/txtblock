# PUBLICATION SYSTEM X
*Rasmus Svensson & Hanna Nilsson (PWR studio)*


## Introduction


XXXXXX

Adding Petabytes of data to the global library everyday.



## Background

What does it mean to publish in a time of xxxxxx? According to the dictionary it is either the business of producing books and magazines or – more broadly – the act of making something public and drawing attention to it. Whereas in the not so distant past publishing was a major enterprise requiring considerable resources it has for the last decade become an increasingly everyday activity. The technology needed for making something public is now omnipresent and the line between private and public is effectively blurred. While the action of having printed, bound and distributed a book, for instance, is an unmistakeable step from the private to the public sphere. In contrast many current publishing tools exist in a grey zone in-between. 

There is additionally the problem of conservation and ownership of the published information. Stored by a few major players, to be analysed and mined for commercial value. 

Address might change, servers go down, companies go out of business. 

The criteria we set up for a publication are:

- publicly available
- uniquely referable


## Proposal

We propose a decentralised system for publishing and distribution of digital text – a sort of ISBN for digital publications. 

open standards

The system consists of three parts

1. A decentralised index
2. A decentralised file sharing system
3. A client application 


### Decentralised index

The core of the system, a sort of ISBN for digital publications.  

Notary function

smart contract

ethereum/blockchain

For example:

3ac225168df54212a25c1c01fd35bebfea408fdac2e31ddd6f80a4bbf9a5f1cb

— censorship proof index 

— tamperproof
Whereas a ISBN number has no connection to the actual information contained in the book.

by using a SHA3 hashing function
fingerprint that will change if a single letter is replaced.

connecting the content to it\s reference. 

— timestamped

Proving when something was published. Similar to for example Origincoin, that is built onto of the bitcoin blockchain.

### Decentralised storage

- swarm
- ipfs
- bittorrent
- storage–agnostic

text-only:
simplicity
connecting with the historical lineage of the book
pure text (unicode) with markdown formatting + meta header 

more popular files will be more widely 

But we might also 

### client

cross-platform: web, phone.

unified reading experience.

similar to medium, filling a empty space in the ebook reader market

clear line between private and public (encrypted and stored locally until published)

open to alternative clients…

### Additional considerations
— anonymity

publicly authored?












*****existing solutions??
