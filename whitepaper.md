# PUBLICATION SYSTEM
*Rasmus Svensson & Hanna Nilsson (PWR studio)*


## Introduction


XXXXXX

Adding Petabytes of data to the global library everyday.



## Background

What does it mean to publish in a time of xxxxxx? According to the dictionary it is either the business of producing books and magazines or – more broadly – the act of making something public and drawing attention to it. Whereas in the not so distant past publishing was a major enterprise requiring considerable resources it has for the last decade become an increasingly everyday activity. The technology needed for making something public is now omnipresent and the line between private and public is effectively blurred. While the action of having printed, bound and distributed a book, for instance, is an unmistakeable step from the private to the public sphere. In contrast many 

There is additionally the problem of conservation and ownership of the published information. Stored by a few major players, to be analysed and mined for commercial value. 

The criteria we set up for a publication are:

- publicly available
- uniquely referable


## Proposal

We propose a decentralised 
a sort of ISBN for digital publications. 

open standards

The system consists of three parts

1. A decentralised index
2. A decentralised file sharing system
3. A client application 


### Decentralised index

The core of the system 

Notary function

smart contract

ethereum/blockchain

— tamperproof
Whereas a ISBN number has no
by using a SHA3 hashing function
fingerprint that will change if a single letter is replaced.

connecting the content to it\s reference. 
— timestamped

### Decentralised storage

- swarm
- ipfs
- bittorrent
- storage–agnostic

text-only:
simplicity
connecting with the historical lineage of the book
pure text (unicode) with markdown formatting + meta header 

### client

similar to medium, filling a empty space in the ebook reader market

cross-platform

clear line between private and public (encrypted and stored locally until published, and then irrevocably public)

### Additional considerations
— anonymity

publicly authored?












— existing solutions??
